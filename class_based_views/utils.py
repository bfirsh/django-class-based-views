    Django doesn't particularly understand REST.
    In case we send data over PUT, Django won't
    actually look at the data and load it. We need

    # Bug fix: if _load_post_and_files has already been called, for
    # example by middleware accessing request.POST, the below code to
    # pretend the request is a POST instead of a PUT will be too late
    # to make a difference. Also calling _load_post_and_files will result 
    # in the following exception:
    #   AttributeError: You cannot set the upload handlers after the upload has been processed.
    # The fix is to check for the presence of the _post field which is set 
    # the first time _load_post_and_files is called (both by wsgi.py and 
    # modpython.py). If it's set, the request has to be 'reset' to redo
    # the query value parsing in POST mode.
